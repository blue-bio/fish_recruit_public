Public data and code for fish grazing around coral recruits experiment 

Month-old multi-polyp and week-old single polyp recruits of _Acropora kenti, Acropora millepora and Goniastrea retiformis_, were exposed to 24 hours of grazing from herbivorous fish _Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Ctenochaetus binotatus, Zebrasoma scopas and Salarias fasciatus,_ then survival of the recruits and changes in algae coverage assessed. Two control treatments - one were an aquarist manually rmoved algae from the tiles and an undisturbed control were also performed.
